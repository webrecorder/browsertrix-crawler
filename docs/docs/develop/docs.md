# Documentation

This documentation is built with the [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) static site generator.

## Docs Setup

Python is required to build the docs, then run:

    pip install mkdocs-material


## Docs Server

To start the docs server, simply run:

    mkdocs serve

The documentation will then be available on `http://localhost:8000/`

The command-line options are rebuilt using the `docs/gen-cli.sh` script.

Refer to the [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) pages
for more info about the documentation.
