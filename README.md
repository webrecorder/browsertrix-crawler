# Browsertrix Crawler

Browsertrix Crawler is a simplified (Chrome)  browser-based high-fidelity crawling system, designed to run a complex, customizable browser-based crawl in a single Docker container. Browsertrix Crawler uses [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster)
and [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to control one or more browsers in parallel.

## Features

Thus far, Browsertrix Crawler supports:

- Single-container, browser based crawling with multiple headless/headful browsers.
- Support for custom browser behaviors, using [Browsertix Behaviors](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-behaviors) including autoscroll, video autoplay and site-specific behaviors.
- Optimized (non-browser) capture of non-HTML resources.
- Extensible Puppeteer driver script for customizing behavior per crawl or page.
- Ability to create and reuse browser profiles with user/password login

## Getting Started

Browsertrix Crawler requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to be installed on the machine running the crawl.

Assuming Docker is installed, you can run a crawl and test your archive with the following steps.

You don't even need to clone this repo, just choose a directory where you'd like the crawl data to be placed, and then run
the following commands. Replace `[URL]` with the web site you'd like to crawl.

1. Run `docker pull webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler`
2. `docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl --url [URL] --generateWACZ --text --collection test`
3. The crawl will now run and progress of the crawl will be output to the console. Depending on the size of the site, this may take a bit!
4. Once the crawl is finished, a WACZ file will be created in `crawls/collection/test/test.wacz` from the directory you ran the crawl!
5. You can go to [ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page) and open the generated WACZ file and browse your newly crawled archive!

Here's how you can use some of the command-line options to configure the crawl:

- To include automated text extraction for full text search, add the `--text` flag.

- To limit the crawl to a maximum number of pages, add `--limit P` where P is the number of pages that will be crawled.

- To run more than one browser worker and crawl in parallel, and `--workers N` where N is number of browsers to run in parallel. More browsers will require more CPU and network bandwidth, and does not guarantee faster crawling.

- To crawl into a new directory, specify a different name for the `--collection` param, or, if omitted, a new collection directory based on current time will be created.
- 

Browsertrix Crawler includes a number of additional command-line options, explained below.

      --profile                             Path to tar.gz file which will be
                                            extracted and used as the browser
                                            profile                     [string]
      --screencastPort                      If set to a non-zero value, starts
                                            an HTTP server with screencast
                                            accessible on this port
                                                           [number] [default: 0]
```

For the `--waitUntil` flag,  see [page.goto waitUntil options](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pagegotourl-options).

The default is `load`, but for static sites, `--wait-until domcontentloaded` may be used to speed up the crawl (to avoid waiting for ads to load for example),
while `--waitUntil networkidle0` may make sense for dynamic sites.


### Behaviors

Browsertrix Crawler also supports automatically running customized in-browser behaviors. The behaviors auto-play videos (when possible),
and auto-fetch content that is not loaded by default, and also run custom behaviors on certain sites.

Behaviors to run can be specified via a comma-separated list passed to the `--behaviors` option. By default, the auto-scroll behavior is not enabled by default, as it may slow down crawling. To enable this behaviors, you can add
`--behaviors autoscroll` or to enable all behaviors, add `--behaviors autoscroll,autoplay,autofetch,siteSpecific`.

See [Browsertrix Behaviors](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-behaviors) for more info on all of the currently available behaviors.


### Watching the crawl -- Screencasting

With version 0.4.0, Browsertrix Crawler includes an experimental 'screencasting' option, which allows watching the crawl in real-time via screencast (connected via a websocket).

To enable, add `--screencastPort` command-line option and also map the port on the docker container. An example command might be:

```
docker-compose run -p 9037:9037 crawler crawl --url [URL] --screencastPort 9037
```

Then, you can open `http://localhost:9037/` and watch the crawl.

Note: If specifying multiple workers, the crawler should additional be instructed to open each one in a new window, otherwise the screencasting can only update one page at a time.

For example,

```
docker-compose run -p 9037:9037 crawler crawl --url [URL] --screencastPort 9037 --newContext window --workers 3
```

will start a crawl with 3 workers, and show the screen of each of the workers from `http://localhost:9037/`.


## Creating and Using Browser Profiles

Browsertrix Crawler also includes a way to use existing browser profiles when running a crawl. This allows pre-configuring the browser, such as by logging in
to certain sites or setting other settings, and running a crawl exactly with those settings. By creating a logged in profile, the actual login credentials are not included in the crawl, only (temporary) session cookies.

Browsertrix Crawler currently includes a script to login to a single website with supplied credentials and then save the profile.
It can also take a screenshot so you can check if the login succeeded. The `--url` parameter should specify the URL of a login page.

For example, to create a profile logged in to Twitter, you can run:

```bash
docker run -v $PWD/crawls/profiles:/output/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler create-login-profile --url "https://twitter.com/login"
```

The script will then prompt you for login credentials, attempt to login and create a tar.gz file in `./crawls/profiles/profile.tar.gz`.

- To specify a custom filename, pass along `--filename` parameter.

- To specify the username and password on the command line (for automated profile creation), pass a `--username` and `--password` flags.

- To specify headless mode, add the `--headless` flag. Note that for crawls run with `--headless` flag, it is recommended to also create the profile with `--headless` to ensure the profile is compatible.

The `--profile` flag can then be used to specify a Chrome profile stored as a tarball when running the regular `crawl` command. With this option, it is possible to crawl with the browser already pre-configured. To ensure compatibility, the profile should be created using the following mechanism.

After running the above command, you can now run a crawl with the profile, as follows:

```bash

docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl --profile /crawls/profiles/profile.tar.gz --url https://twitter.com/--generateWACZ --collection test-with-profile
```

The current profile creation script is still experimental and the script attempts to detect the usename and password fields on a site as generically as possible, but may not work for all sites. Additional profile functionality, such as support for custom profile creation scripts, may be added in the future. 


## Architecture

The Docker container provided here packages up several components used in Browsertrix.

The system uses:
 - `oldwebtoday/chrome` - to install a recent version of Chrome (currently chrome:84)
 - `puppeteer-cluster` - for running Chrome browsers in parallel
 - `pywb` - in recording mode for capturing the content


The crawl produces a single pywb collection, at `/crawls/collections/<collection name>` in the Docker container.

To access the contents of the crawl, the `/crawls` directory in the container should be mounted to a volume (default in the Docker Compose setup).



### Example Usage


#### With Docker-Compose

The Docker Compose file can simplify building and running a crawl, and includes some required settings for `docker run`, including mounting a volume.

For example, the following commands demonstrate building the image, running a simple crawl with 2 workers:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run crawler crawl --url https://webrecorder.net/ --generateCDX --collection wr-net --workers 2
```

In this example, the crawl data is written to `./crawls/collections/wr-net` by default.

While the crawl is running, the status of the crawl (provide by puppeteer-cluster monitoring) prints the progress to the Docker log.

When done, you can even use the browsertrix-crawler image to also start a local [pywb](https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb) instance
to preview the crawl:

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/crawls:/crawls -p 8080:8080 webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler pywb
```

Then, loading the `http://localhost:8080/wr-net/https://webrecorder.net/` should load a recent crawl of the `https://webrecorder.net/` site.


#### With `docker run`

Browsertrix Crawler can of course all be run directly with Docker run, but requires a few more options.

In particular, the `--cap-add` and `--shm-size`
flags are [needed to run Chrome in Docker](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/v1.0.0/docs/troubleshooting.md#tips).


```bash
docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --shm-size=1g -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler --url https://webrecorder.net/ --workers 2

```


Support
-------

Initial support for development of Browsertrix Crawler, was provided by [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/)

Initial functionality for Browsertrix Crawler was developed to support the [zimit](https://github.com/openzim/zimit) project in a collaboration between
Webrecorder and Kiwix, and this project has been split off from Zimit into a core component of Webrecorder.
