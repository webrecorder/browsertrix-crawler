# Browsertrix Crawler

Browsertrix Crawler is a simplified (Chrome)  browser-based high-fidelity crawling system, designed to run a complex, customizable browser-based crawl in a single Docker container. Browsertrix Crawler uses [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster)
and [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to control one or more browsers in parallel.

## Features

Thus far, Browsertrix Crawler supports:

- Single-container, browser based crawling with multiple headless/headful browsers.
- Support for custom browser behaviors, using [Browsertix Behaviors](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-behaviors) including autoscroll, video autoplay and site-specific behaviors.
- Optimized (non-browser) capture of non-HTML resources.
- Extensible Puppeteer driver script for customizing behavior per crawl or page.
- Ability to create and reuse browser profiles with user/password login

## Getting Started

Browsertrix Crawler requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to be installed on the machine running the crawl.

Assuming Docker is installed, you can run a crawl and test your archive with the following steps.

You don't even need to clone this repo, just choose a directory where you'd like the crawl data to be placed, and then run
the following commands. Replace `[URL]` with the web site you'd like to crawl.

1. Run `docker pull webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler`
2. `docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl --url [URL] --generateWACZ --text --collection test`
3. The crawl will now run and progress of the crawl will be output to the console. Depending on the size of the site, this may take a bit!
4. Once the crawl is finished, a WACZ file will be created in `crawls/collection/test/test.wacz` from the directory you ran the crawl!
5. You can go to [ReplayWeb.page](https://replayweb.page) and open the generated WACZ file and browse your newly crawled archive!

Here's how you can use some of the command-line options to configure the crawl:

- To include automated text extraction for full text search, add the `--text` flag.

- To limit the crawl to a maximum number of pages, add `--limit P` where P is the number of pages that will be crawled.

- To run more than one browser worker and crawl in parallel, and `--workers N` where N is number of browsers to run in parallel. More browsers will require more CPU and network bandwidth, and does not guarantee faster crawling.

- To crawl into a new directory, specify a different name for the `--collection` param, or, if omitted, a new collection directory based on current time will be created.

Browsertrix Crawler includes a number of additional command-line options, explained below.

</details>


### Waiting for Page Load

One of the key nuances of browser-based crawling is determining when a page is finished loading. This can be configured with the `--waitUntil` flag.

The default is `load,networkidle2`, which waits until page load and <=2 requests remain, but for static sites, `--wait-until domcontentloaded` may be used to speed up the crawl (to avoid waiting for ads to load for example). The `--waitUntil networkidle0` may make sense for sites, where absolutely all requests must be waited until before proceeding.

See [page.goto waitUntil options](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pagegotourl-options) for more info on the options that can be used with this flag from the Puppeteer docs.


### YAML Crawl Config

Browsertix Crawler supports the use of a yaml file to set parameters for a crawl. This can be used by passing a valid yaml file to the `--config` option.

The YAML file can contain the same parameters as the command-line arguments. If a parameter is set on the command-line and in the yaml file, the value from the command-line will be used. For example, the following should start a crawl with config in `crawl-config.yaml`.


```
docker run -v $PWD/crawl-config.yaml:/app/crawl-config.yaml -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl —-config /app/crawl-config.yaml
```

The config can also be passed via stdin, which can simplify the command. Note that this require running `docker run` with the `-i` flag. To read config from stdin, pass `--config stdin`

```
cat ./crawl-config.yaml | docker run -i -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl —-config stdin
```


An example config file (eg. crawl-config.yaml) might contain:

```
seeds:
  - https://example.com/
  - https://www.iana.org/

combineWARCs: true
```

The list of seeds can be loaded via an external file by specifying the filename via the `seedFile` config or command-line option.

#### Seed File

The URL seed file should be a text file formatted so that each line of the file is a url string. (An example file is available in the fixture folder as urlSeedFile.txt)

The seed file must be passed as a volume to the docker container. To do that, you can format your docker command similar to the following:

```
docker run -v $PWD/seedFile.txt:/app/seedFile.txt -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl —-seedFile /app/seedFile.txt
```

#### Per-Seed Settings

Certain settings such scope type, scope includes and excludes, and depth can also be configured per seed directly in the YAML file, for example:

```
seeds:
  - url: https://webrecorder.net/
    depth: 1
    type: "prefix"
```

### Scope Types

The crawl scope can be configured globally for all seeds, or customized per seed, by specifying the `--scopeType` command-line option or setting the `type` property for each seed.

The scope controls which linked pages are also included in the crawl.

The available types are:

- `page` - crawl only this page, but load any links that include different hashtags. Useful for single-page apps that may load different content based on hashtag.

- `prefix` - crawl any pages in the same directory, eg. starting from `https://example.com/path/page.html`, crawl anything under `https://example.com/path/` (default)

- `host` - crawl pages that share the same host.

- `any` - crawl any and all pages.

- `none` - don't crawl any additional pages besides the seed.


The `depth` setting also limits how many pages will be crawled for that seed, while the `limit` option sets the total
number of pages crawled from any seed.

### Block Rules

While scope rules define which pages are to be crawled, it is also possible to block certain URLs in certain pages or frames from being recorded.

This is useful for blocking ads or other content that should not be included.

The block rules can be specified as a list in the `blockRules` field. Each rule can contain one of the following fields:

- `url`: regex for URL to match (required)

- `type`: can be `block` or `allowOnly`. The block rule blocks the specified match, while allowOnly inverts the match and allows only the matched URLs, while blocking all others.

- `inFrameUrl`: if specified, indicates that the rule only applies when `url` is loaded in a specific iframe or top-level frame.

- `frameTextMatch`: if specified, the text of the specified URL is checked for the regex, and the rule applies only if there is an additional match. When specified, this field makes the block rule apply only to frame-level resource, eg. URLs loaded directly in an iframe or top-level frame.

For example, a very simple block rule that blocks all URLs from 'googleanalytics.com' can be added with:

```
blockRules:
   - url: googleanalytics.com
```

For additional examples of block rules, see the [tests/blockrules.test.js](tests/blockrules.test.js) file in the test suite.

If the `--blockMessage` is also specified, a blocked URL is replaced with the specified message (added as a WARC resource record).


### Custom Warcinfo Fields

Custom fields can be added to the `warcinfo` WARC record, generated for each combined WARCs. The fields can be specified in the YAML config under `warcinfo` section or specifying individually via the command-line.

For example, the following are equivalent ways to add additional warcinfo fields:


via yaml config:

```yaml
warcinfo:
  operator: my-org
  hostname: hostname.my-org
```

via command-line:

```
--warcinfo.operator my-org --warcinfo.hostname hostname.my-org

```

### Behaviors

Browsertrix Crawler also supports automatically running customized in-browser behaviors. The behaviors auto-play videos (when possible),
and auto-fetch content that is not loaded by default, and also run custom behaviors on certain sites.

Behaviors to run can be specified via a comma-separated list passed to the `--behaviors` option. By default, the auto-scroll behavior is not enabled by default, as it may slow down crawling. To enable this behaviors, you can add
`--behaviors autoscroll` or to enable all behaviors, add `--behaviors autoscroll,autoplay,autofetch,siteSpecific`.

The site-specific behavior (or autoscroll) will start running after the page is finished its initial load (as defined by the `--waitUntil` settings). The behavior will then run until finished or until the behavior timeout is exceeded. This timeout can be set (in seconds) via the `--behaviorTimeout` flag (90 seconds by default). Setting the timeout to 0 will allow the behavior to run until it is finished.

See [Browsertrix Behaviors](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-behaviors) for more info on all of the currently available behaviors.


### Watching the crawl -- Screencasting

With version 0.4.0, Browsertrix Crawler includes an experimental 'screencasting' option, which allows watching the crawl in real-time via screencast (connected via a websocket).

To enable, add `--screencastPort` command-line option and also map the port on the docker container. An example command might be:

```
docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl -p 9037:9037 --url https://www.example.com --screencastPort 9037
```

Then, you can open `http://localhost:9037/` and watch the crawl.

Note: If specifying multiple workers, the crawler should additional be instructed to open each one in a new window, otherwise the screencasting can only update one page at a time.

For example,

```
docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl -p 9037:9037 --url https://www.example.com --screencastPort 9037 --newContext window --workers 3
```

will start a crawl with 3 workers, and show the screen of each of the workers from `http://localhost:9037/`.


## Creating and Using Browser Profiles

Browsertrix Crawler also includes a way to use existing browser profiles when running a crawl. This allows pre-configuring the browser, such as by logging in
to certain sites or setting other settings, and running a crawl exactly with those settings. By creating a logged in profile, the actual login credentials are not included in the crawl, only (temporary) session cookies.

Browsertrix Crawler includes a script to login to a single website with supplied credentials and then save the profile, as well as a new 'interactive' profile creation mode.
The script profile creation system also take a screenshot so you can check if the login succeeded. The `--url` parameter should specify the URL of a login page.

For example, to create a profile logged in to Twitter, you can run:

```bash
docker run -v $PWD/crawls/profiles:/output/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler create-login-profile --url "https://twitter.com/login"
```

The script will then prompt you for login credentials, attempt to login and create a tar.gz file in `./crawls/profiles/profile.tar.gz`.

- To specify a custom filename, pass along `--filename` parameter.

- To specify the username and password on the command line (for automated profile creation), pass a `--username` and `--password` flags.

- To specify headless mode, add the `--headless` flag. Note that for crawls run with `--headless` flag, it is recommended to also create the profile with `--headless` to ensure the profile is compatible.

- To specify the window size for the profile creation embedded browser, specify `--windowSize WIDTH,HEIGHT`. (The default is 1600x900)


The current profile creation script is still experimental and the script attempts to detect the username and password fields on a site as generically as possible, but may not work for all sites. Additional profile functionality, such as support for custom profile creation scripts, may be added in the future.


### Interactive Profile Creation

For creating profiles of more complex sites, or logging in to multiple sites at once, the interactive profile creation mode can be used.
To use this mode, specify the `--interactive` flag and expose two ports on the Docker container to allow DevTools to connect to the browser and to serve
a status page.

In this mode, Browsertrix launches a browser connected to DevTools, and allowing the user to use the browser via the devtools device UI.

After interactively logging into desired sites or configuring other settings, the 'Create Profile' should be clicked to initiate profile creation.

Browsertrix Crawler will then create a profile as before using the current state of the browser and disconnect from devtools.

For example, to start in interactive profile creation mode, run:

```
docker run -p 9222:9222 -p 9223:9223 -v $PWD/profiles:/output/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler create-login-profile --interactive --url "https://example.com/"
```

Then, open a browser pointing to `http://localhost:9223/` and use the embedded browser to log in to any sites or configure any settings as needed.
Click 'Create Profile at the top when done. The profile will then be created in `./crawls/profiles/profile.tar.gz` containing the settings of this browsing session.

It is also possible to extend an existing profiles by also passing in an existing profile via the `--profile` flag. In this way, it is possible to build new profiles by extending previous browsing sessions as needed.

```
docker run -p 9222:9222 -p 9223:9223 -v $PWD/profiles:/profiles --filename /profiles/newProfile.tar.gz -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler create-login-profile --interactive --url "https://example.com/ --profile /profiles/oldProfile.tar.gz"
```

### Using Browser Profile with a Crawl

To use a previously created profile with a crawl, use the `--profile` flag or `profile` option. The `--profile` flag can then be used to specify any Chrome profile stored as a tarball. Using profiles created with same or older version of Browsertrix Crawler is recommended to ensure compatibility. This option allows running a crawl with the browser already pre-configured, logged in to certain sites, language settings configured, etc...

After running the above command, you can now run a crawl with the profile, as follows:

```bash

docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls/ -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler crawl --profile /crawls/profiles/profile.tar.gz --url https://twitter.com/--generateWACZ --collection test-with-profile
```

## Published Releases / Production Use

When using Browsertrix Crawler in production, it is recommended to use a specific, published version of the image, eg. `webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler:[VERSION]` instead of `webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler` where `[VERSION]` corresponds to one of the published release tag.

All released Docker Images are available from Docker Hub, listed by release tag here: https://hub.docker.com/r/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated

Details for each corresponding release tag are also available on GitHub at: https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler/releases


## Architecture

The Docker container provided here packages up several components used in Browsertrix.

The system uses:
 - `oldwebtoday/chrome` or `oldwebtoday/chromium` - to install a recent version of Chrome (currently chrome:90) or Chromium (see below).
 - `puppeteer-cluster` - for running Chrome browsers in parallel
 - `pywb` - in recording mode for capturing the content


The crawl produces a single pywb collection, at `/crawls/collections/<collection name>` in the Docker container.

To access the contents of the crawl, the `/crawls` directory in the container should be mounted to a volume (default in the Docker Compose setup).


### Usage with Docker Compose

Many examples in this README demonstrate running Browsertrix Crawler with `docker run`.

Docker Compose is recommended for building the image and for simple configurations.

For example, to build the latest image, simply run:

```
docker-compose build
```

Docker Compose also simplifies some config options, such as mounting the volume for the crawls.

For example, the following command starts a crawl with 2 workers and generates the CDX.

```
docker-compose run crawler crawl --url https://webrecorder.net/ --generateCDX --collection wr-net --workers 2
```

In this example, the crawl data is written to `./crawls/collections/wr-net` by default.


While the crawl is running, the status of the crawl (provide by puppeteer-cluster monitoring) prints the progress to the Docker log.


### Multi-Platform Build / Support for Apple M1

Browsertrix Crawler uses a browser image which supports amd64 and arm64 (currently `oldwebtoday/chrome:91`).

This means Browsertrix Crawler can be built natively on Apple M1 systems using the default settings. Simply running `docker-compose build` on an Apple M1 should build a native version that should work for development.

On M1 system, the browser used will be Chromium instead of Chrome since there is no Linux build of Chrome for ARM, and this now is handled automatically as part of the build.


### Custom Browser Image

It is also possible to build Browsertrix Crawler with a different browser image. Currently, browser images from `oldwebtoday/chrome` and `oldwebtoday/chromium` are supported.

For example, Webrecorder provides the `oldwebtoday/chromium:91-arm` for running Browsertrix Crawler on ARM-based systems.

To build with this specific Chromium image on an Apple M1 machine, run:

```
docker-compose build --build-arg BROWSER_IMAGE_BASE=oldwebtoday/chromium --build-arg "BROWSER_VERSION=91-arm" --build-arg BROWSER_BIN=chromium-browser
```

The build arguments specify the base image, version and browser binary. This approach can also be used to install a different browser in general from any Debian-based Docker image. Additional browser images may be added in the future.

### Viewing crawled data with pywb

When a crawler is done, another browsertrix-crawler image can be started with a local [pywb](https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb) instance to view crawl:

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/crawls:/crawls -p 8080:8080 webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler pywb
```

Then, loading the `http://localhost:8080/wr-net/https://webrecorder.net/` should load a recent crawl of the `https://webrecorder.net/` site.

(Previewing crawl results while a crawl its still running should also be possible soon!)


Support
-------
