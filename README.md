# Browsertrix Crawler 1.x

Browsertrix Crawler is a standalone browser-based high-fidelity crawling system, designed to run a complex, customizable browser-based crawl in a single Docker container. Browsertrix Crawler uses [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to control one or more [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) browser windows in parallel. Data is captured through the [Chrome Devtools Protocol (CDP)](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) in the browser.

For information on how to use and develop Browsertrix Crawler, see the hosted [Browsertrix Crawler documentation](https://crawler.docs.browsertrix.com).
