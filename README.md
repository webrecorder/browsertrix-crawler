# Browsertrix Crawler

Browsertrix Crawler is a simplified browser-based high-fidelity crawling system, designed to run a single crawl in a single Docker container. It is designed as part of a more streamlined replacement of the original [Browsertrix](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix).

The original Browsertrix may be too complex for situations where a single crawl is needed, and requires managing multiple containers.

This is an attempt to refactor Browsertrix into a core crawling system, driven by [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster)
and [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)

## Features

Thus far, Browsertrix Crawler supports:

- Single-container, browser based crawling with multiple headless/headful browsers
- Support for some behaviors: autoplay to capture video/audio, scrolling
- Support for direct capture for non-HTML resources
- Extensible driver script for customizing behavior per crawl or page via Puppeteer

## Architecture

The Docker container provided here packages up several components used in Browsertrix.

The system uses:
 - `oldwebtoday/chrome` - to install a recent version of Chrome (currently chrome:84)
 - `puppeteer-cluster` - for running Chrome browsers in parallel
 - `pywb` - in recording mode for capturing the content


The crawl produces a single pywb collection, at `/crawls/collections/<collection name>` in the Docker container.

To access the contents of the crawl, the `/crawls` directory in the container should be mounted to a volume (default in the Docker Compose setup).


## Crawling Parameters

The image currently accepts the following parameters:

```
browsertrix-crawler [options]

                                                   [string] [default: "capture"]
      --headless     Run in headless mode, otherwise start xvfb
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
      --driver       JS driver for the crawler
                                     [string] [default: "/app/defaultDriver.js"]
      --generateCDX  If set, generate index (CDXJ) for use with pywb after crawl
                     is done                          [boolean] [default: false]
      --generateWACZ If set, generate wacz for use with pywb after crawl
                      is done                          [boolean] [default: false]
      --combineWARC If set, combine the individual warcs generated into a single warc after crawl
                      is done                          [boolean] [default: false]
      --rolloverSize If set, dictates the maximum size that a generated warc and combined warc can be
                                                      [number] [default: 1000000000]
      --text         If set, extract the pages full text to be added to the pages.jsonl  
                      file                         [boolean] [default: false]
      --cwd          Crawl working directory for captures (pywb root). If not
                     set, defaults to process.cwd  [string] [default: "/crawls"]
```

For the `--waitUntil` flag,  see [page.goto waitUntil options](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pagegotourl-options).

The default is `load`, but for static sites, `--wait-until domcontentloaded` may be used to speed up the crawl (to avoid waiting for ads to load for example),
while `--waitUntil networkidle0` may make sense for dynamic sites.

### Example Usage


#### With Docker-Compose

The Docker Compose file can simplify building and running a crawl, and includes some required settings for `docker run`, including mounting a volume.

For example, the following commands demonstrate building the image, running a simple crawl with 2 workers:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run crawler crawl --url https://webrecorder.net/ --generateCDX --collection wr-net --workers 2
```

In this example, the crawl data is written to `./crawls/collections/wr-net` by default.

While the crawl is running, the status of the crawl (provide by puppeteer-cluster monitoring) prints the progress to the Docker log.

When done, you can even use the browsertrix-crawler image to also start a local [pywb](https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb) instance
to preview the crawl:

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/crawls:/crawls -p 8080:8080 webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler pywb
```

Then, loading the `http://localhost:8080/wr-net/https://webrecorder.net/` should load a recent crawl of the `https://webrecorder.net/` site.


#### With `docker run`

Browsertrix Crawler can of course all be run directly with Docker run, but requires a few more options.

In particular, the `--cap-add` and `--shm-size`
flags are [needed to run Chrome in Docker](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/v1.0.0/docs/troubleshooting.md#tips).


```bash
docker run -v $PWD/crawls:/crawls --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --shm-size=1g -it webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler --url https://webrecorder.net/ --workers 2

```


Support
-------

Initial support for development of Browsertrix Crawler, was provided by [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/)

Initial functionality for Browsertrix Crawler was developed to support the [zimit](https://github.com/openzim/zimit) project in a collaboration between
Webrecorder and Kiwix, and this project has been split off from Zimit into a core component of Webrecorder.
