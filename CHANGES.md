v0.6.0

- Add a --waitOnDone option, which has browsertrix crawler wait when finished (for use with Browsertrix Cloud)
- When running with redis shared state, set the :status field to running, failing/failed or done to let job controller know crawl is finished.
- Set redis state to failing in case of exception, set to failed in case of >3 or more failed exits within 60 seconds (but don't mark as failed if all pages are finished and >0 pages.
- When receiving a SIGUSR1, don't wait on down (assume final exit due to scale down).
- More efficient screencasting, don't end screencasting when page ends, only when target is destroyed!
- Keep same screencasting connection from one page to next, as the target are reused in 'window' concurrency mode
- Size limit (in bytes) via --sizeLimit
- Total time limit (in bytes) via --timeLimit
- Overwrite collection (delete existing) via --overwrite
- Fixes to interrupting a single instance in a shared state crawl
- force all cookies, including session cookies, to fixed duration in days, configurable via --cookieDays


v0.5.0
- Scope: support for `scopeType: domain` to include all subdomains and ignoring 'www.' if specified in the seed.

- Non-HTML Pages: Load non-200 responses in browser, even if non-html, fix waiting issues with non-HTML pages (eg. PDFs)

- Page behavior: latest browsertrix-behaviors, also add experimental Cloudflare interstitial wait.
- Error handling: better error handling for redis errors
- State: Support loading of crawl state from config.yaml
- State: Support serialization of crawl state to `crawls` subdirectory, both while running (keeping last N states) and on exit.

- State: Memory or Redis based crawl state
- Config: Support additional options via `CRAWL_ARGS` environment variable
- WACZ Upload: Support for S3 upload of WACZ upon crawl completion

- Signing: Support for optional signing of WACZ
- Dependencies: update to latest pywb, wacz and browsertrix-behaviors packages


v0.4.4
- Page Block Rules Fix: 'request already handled' errors by avoiding adding duplicate handlers to same page.
- Page Block Rules Fix: await all continue/abort() calls and catch errors.
- Page Block Rules: Don't apply to top-level page, print warning and recommend scope rules instead.
- Setup: Attempt to create the crawl working directory (cwd) specified via --cwd if it doesn't exist.
- Scope Types: Rename 'none' -> 'page' (single page only) and 'page' -> 'page-spa' (page with hashtags).
- README: Add more scope rule examples, clarify distinction between scope rules and block rules.
- README: Update old type -> scopeType, list new scope types.

v0.4.3
- BlockRules Fixes: When considering the 'inFrameUrl' for a navigation request for an iframe, use URL of parent frame.
- BlockRules Fixes: Always allow pywb proxy scripts.

v0.4.2
- Compose/docs: Build latest image by default, update README to refer to latest image
- Fix typo in `crawler.capturePrefix` that resulted in `directFetchCapture()` always failing
- Tests: Update all tests to use `test-crawls` directory

v0.4.1
- BlockRules Optimizations: don't intercept requests if no blockRules
- Profile Creation: Support extending existing profile by passing a --profile param to load on startup
- Profile Creation: Set default window size to 1600x900, add --windowSize param for setting custom size
- Behavior Timeouts: Add --behaviorTimeout to specify custom timeout for behaviors, in seconds (defaulting to 90 seconds)

v0.4.0
- YAML based config, specifyable via --config property or via stdin (with '--config stdin')

- Per-Seed scoping, including different scope types, or depth and include/exclude rules configurable per seed in 'seeds' list via YAML config

- Interactive profile creation: creating profiles by interacting with embedded browser loaded in the browser (see README for more details).

- Simplified custom driver config, default calls 'loadPage'
